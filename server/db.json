Go and discover more about music and instruments of the orchestra in the beautiful setting of the Jerwood Hall in specially designed concerts by LSO musicians and students from the Guildhall School. The concerts offer an informal introduction to the LSO and the world of music-making. Presenter Rachel Leach talks about the works and the instruments, and there are opportunities to ask questions of Rachel and the musicians. For this one members of the LSO string section perform Mendelssohn's Octet as part of a series of concerts focussing on how composers reflected the French Impressionist art movement."
